Iran had a few hundred working centrifuges in 2003, thousands when Mr\nBurns, the deputy secretary of state who led the secret effort to establish relations with Iran\u2019s new president, Hassan Rouhani, put it recently: \u201cYou can\u2019t bomb knowledge\nIt was hoped that those attacks, combined with economic sanctions, would force Iran to see the folly of continuing on its path.\nBack then, the thinking was that Iran could have only a token production capability\nHe read briefings on three different proposals for how to convert a heavy-water reactor at Arak so that it could remain in operation without churning out plutonium waste that could be used in a bomb\nInstead of maintaining strict limits throughout the life of a 15-year accord, for example, it began to talk about keeping the toughest limits \u2014 the ones that would extend to a year the time Iran needed to produce enough nuclear material for a bomb \u2014 in place for at least 10 years.\n\u201cYou hear that kind of stuff and you want to say, \u2018Why don\u2019t you sit at the table for months on end and see if you do any better?\u2019 \u201d one of Mr\nObama to send Ernest Moniz, his energy secretary and one of the nation\u2019s leading nuclear scientists\nSherman, one of the most organized of diplomats, continued rolling out her whiteboards, a stark contrast with the elegance of the rooms they were meeting in at the Beau Rivage\nHe went for crepes down the street and showed up at a bar to help celebrate the birthdays of some American reporters\n\u201cThe trick was getting it to come together \u2014 you can see it, you see the deal,\u201d a senior administration official said\nThe Iranians knew the deadline meant a lot to Mr\n\u201cAnd I was the lucky one.\u201d\nWhen the Iranians insisted on keeping some centrifuges at Fordo, Mr\nThe same thing happened in finding a solution for the Arak heavy-water reactor, which they agreed to redesign\nObama was pressing intelligence agencies for a report on the real intentions of Ayatollah Khamenei, who would cast the sole deciding vote on any deal in Iran\nComplicating things further, the Iranians did not want to publish a list of agreed upon points\nKerry stepped to the microphones on Thursday and talked about all the limits on Iran, and how some would last 15 years, others 25, a few for much longer, Mr\nA version of this article appears in print on April 4, 2015, on page A1 of the  New York edition  with the headline: White Board, All-Nighters and Espresso", "Class": "General", "Keywords": ["astoundingly high bills \u2014 suites run", "peter baker contributed reporting", "sanctions relief remains unresolved", "negotiate arms control agreements", "espresso machine constantly buzzed", "state john kerry prepared", "sides made significant compromises"]}
