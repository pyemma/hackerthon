She tried out a line on an imaginary audience: \u201cFolks, this is why we dance.\u201d\n\u201cWhat kind of choices does it suggest politically? What\u2019s fair? What\u2019s just? This can all be reflected in a dance.\u201d\nIt was always about working in tandem to a new point.\u201d\nOrder Reprints |    Today's Paper | Subscribe", "Class": "Arts", "Date": "Sat, 04 Apr 2015 19:43:00 GMT", "Image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/05/arts/05THARP1/05THRAP1-moth.jpg", "Link": "http://rss.nytimes.com/c/34625/f/640308/s/451d1290/sc/38/l/0L0Snytimes0N0C20A150C0A40C0A50Carts0Cdance0Ctwyla0Etharps0E50A0Eyears0Eof0Eforward0Emovement0Bhtml0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm"}
