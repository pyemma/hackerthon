{"Summary": "Keeping Score: A Litmus Test for the Golden State Warriors, a Sure Thing\n\nThe Golden State Warriors, who have looked virtually incapable of losing in the regular season, will enter the N.B.A\nWith a record of 62-13 entering Saturday night\u2019s game against the  Mavericks , the Warriors were already tied for the 28th-most victories in an N.B.A\nWith the Warriors seemingly on their way to that victory benchmark, the cases of the three teams that failed to win it all are instructive in an evaluation of the Warriors.\nThe 1972-73 Celtics were the most successful regular-season team in franchise history, but for a team accustomed to earning championship rings, the failure of this squad even to make the finals must still sting\nThe team played fast, with the third-quickest pace in the N.B.A., but it was also tough on defense, giving up an estimated 91 points per 100 possessions\nWhen the playoffs came around, the Celtics won a six-game series against the Atlanta Hawks, but they ran out of gas against the Knicks in the Eastern Conference finals\nOf the 12 players who took the floor for the team that season, six went on to coach in the N.B.A\nBut they did have  LeBron James , and that was nearly enough.\nIn the second-to-last season of his first stint in Cleveland, James was at his best\nThere were few weaknesses on the Mavericks, a team led by  Dirk Nowitzki  that played strong offense and defense, but the Warriors of that season stormed to the playoffs and, on the strength of tremendous efforts by Baron Davis and Stephen Jackson, became one of the few No\n1 and 2 in defensive rating, which is the estimated number of points they allow per 100 possessions.\non a per-possession basis; they just have the fastest pace of any team in the game.\nSo the Champagne will have to remain on ice for now.\nA version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2015, on page SP15 of the  New York edition  with the headline: Cautionary Tales for a Sure Thing", "Date": "Sat, 04 Apr 2015 22:37:20 GMT", "Image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/05/sports/DOG-SCORE-1/DOG-SCORE-1-moth.jpg", "Link": "http://rss.nytimes.com/c/34625/f/640382/s/451cec50/sc/13/l/0L0Snytimes0N0C20A150C0A40C0A50Csports0Cbasketball0Ca0Elitmus0Etest0Efor0Ethe0Egolden0Estate0Ewarriors0Ea0Esure0Ething0Bhtml0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm", "Keywords": ["year head coach steve kerr", "player efficiency rating \u2014 zydrunas ilgauskas", "high player efficiency rating", "valuable player award", "13 entering saturday night", "played strong offense", "ruthlessly efficient manner"], "Title": "Keeping Score: A Litmus Test for the Golden State Warriors, a Sure Thing", "Class": "Sports"}
