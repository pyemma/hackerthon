{"Summary": "Final Tweaks to Mets\u2019 Roster Made With Higher Aspirations\n\nNow that the Mets are entering the season with at least faint hopes of making the postseason, those decisions carry more meaning\nAnd, at least to start the season, the Mets will carry an extra reliever and one fewer bench player, because, in part, of contract logistics.\nIf Buddy Carlyle had not made the roster, he reportedly could have opted out of his contract, and if Sean Gilmartin, a Rule 5 draft pick, had not made the roster, the Mets would have lost his rights\nThe bullpen could look drastically different by the middle of May, when Bobby Parnell, the former closer, is expected to return from Tommy John surgery\nManager  Terry Collins  will have a month or so to determine which of the three to keep on the roster.\nThe only surprising development was the failure of Eric Campbell, whom some had regarded as a potential super sub, to make the roster\nI worked my butt off this off-season to make the opening day roster.\nOrder Reprints |    Today's Paper | Subscribe", "Date": "Sun, 05 Apr 2015 02:17:00 GMT", "Image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/05/sports/05mets1/05mets1-moth.jpg", "Link": "http://rss.nytimes.com/c/34625/f/640382/s/451d9941/sc/13/l/0L0Snytimes0N0C20A150C0A40C0A50Csports0Cbaseball0Cfinal0Etweaks0Eto0Emets0Eroster0Emade0Ewith0Ehigher0Easpirations0Bhtml0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm", "Keywords": ["mets finished spring training saturday", "newly acquired jerry blevins", "spring training wound", "dillon gee beat", "rule 5 draft pick", "final exhibition game", "manager  terry collins"], "Title": "Final Tweaks to Mets\u2019 Roster Made With Higher Aspirations", "Class": "Sports"}
