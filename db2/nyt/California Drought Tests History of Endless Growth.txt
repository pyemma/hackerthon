the evidence of it can be seen in the construction cranes dotting the skylines of Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\u201cMother Nature didn\u2019t intend for 40 million people to live here,\u201d said Kevin Starr, a historian at the University of Southern California who has written extensively about this state\nStarr said, \u201cis not going to go under, but we are going to have to go in a different way.\u201d\nCalifornia\u2019s $2.2 trillion economy today  is the seventh largest  in the world, more than quadruple the $520 billion economy of 1963, adjusted for inflation\n\u201cYou just can\u2019t live the way you always have,\u201d said Mr\n\u201cNow we are embarked upon an experiment that no one has ever tried: 38 million people, with 32 million vehicles, living at the level of comfort that we all strive to attain\nInteractive Graphic: How Much Water Californians Use at Home\nThis disconnect, as it were, can be seen in places like Palm Springs, in the middle of the desert, where daily per capita water use is 201 gallons \u2014 more than double the state average\nBut the drought is now forcing change in a place that long identified itself as \u201cAmerica\u2019s desert oasis.\u201d Palm Springs has ordered 50 percent cuts in water use by city agencies, and plans to replace the lawns and annual flowers around city buildings with native landscapes\nAt the airport that once welcomed winter-chilled tourists with eight acres of turf and flowers, city officials are in the early stages of replacing the grass with cactus, desert bushes and paloverde trees\n\u201cYears ago the idea was, come to Palm Springs, and people see the grass and the lushness and the green,\u201d Mr\nMayor Robert Silva of Mendota, in the heart of the agricultural Central Valley, said unemployment among farmworkers had soared as the soil turned to crust and farmers left half or more of their fields fallow\n\u201cGive me some water, and I know I can go to work, that\u2019s the bottom line.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be harder and harder to build new housing without an adequate water supply,\u201d he said\n\u201cThis has been a problem for as long as I\u2019ve been alive.\u201d\n\u201cThey keep building homes, but where\u2019s the water going to come from?\u201d\nThe 400 local water supply agencies will determine  how to achieve that goal ; much of it is expected to be done by imposing new restrictions on lawn watering\nBrown\u2019s executive order and his own city\u2019s success in reducing water consumption, said he was confident that the state would find ways to deal with an era of reduced water supplies, in a way that would permit it to continue to grow and thrive.\n\u201cWe have to deal with a new normal,\u201d Mr\n\u201cThe rest of the economy is managing it, learning how to deal with it,\u201d he said.\nThere has to be a more evolved way about using the resources we have\nBrown has succeeded in persuading people here to  shake long-held habits  and assumptions.\n\u201cThe state does not know how to arrange the resources they have, and so we have to pay for it,\u201d he said\n\u201cThe idea, at least until the latter part of the 20th century, was that water would be cheap and plentiful and the focus was on developing new supplies,\u201d said Heather Cooley, water program director for the Pacific Institute, an environmental research group based in Oakland\nTotal water use in Los Angeles, San Francisco and many other urban areas is now lower than it was in 1980, despite the huge economic growth and population increases.\n\u201cAnd what Californians see as beautiful,\u201d she said, \u201chas been a lawn that has been the standard for front yards and backyards.\u201d\nNow, with utilities paying people to replace thirsty traditional grass turf with water-sipping native plants and other drought-tolerant shrubbery, long-held aesthetics are shifting\nBut even a significant drop in residential water use will not move the consumption needle nearly as much as even a small reduction by farmers\nBill Melzer, 72, a bond broker walking his dog on a sunny morning in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco, said he was worried about the drought, about the prospect of higher fines for using too much water and about what might happen to the agriculture industry\n\u201cThe dream of California now is probably different than back in the 1960s,\u201d he said\nStarr, the University of Southern California historian, said the crisis would force California to do what was needed to carry on\n\u201cEvery time California has a problem \u2014 we ran out of electricity in the early 2000s, then we ran out of money, and now we are running out of water \u2014 people say California is over,\u201d Dr\nAdam Nagourney and Jack Healy reported from Los Angeles, and Nelson D\nOrder Reprints |    Today's Paper | Subscribe"}
