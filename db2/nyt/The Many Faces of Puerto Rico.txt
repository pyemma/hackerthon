That seems to be its aim, and perhaps it\u2019s only natural that a place that has been trying to redefine its status and relationship with the United States for more than a century would offer a shifting identity, seeking to be all things to all comers\nMurals on underpasses gave way to glistening hotel towers, which gave way to the rustic beaches of Vieques.\nThat much was clear from the moment I arrived, and I couldn\u2019t wait to see more.\nSpain lost the islands in the 1890s, rather late in the colonial scramble for the Caribbean, and as a result Puerto Rico has retained a Latin-infused language and heritage, evident in music ranging from bomba to salsa to reggaeton.\nLa Productora, for example, is part of a Calle Cerra collaborative, a group of young aspiring artists and gallerists\nWith government and private backing, graffiti artists and muralists who operate under names like the all-female Morivivi collective and Bikismo, a solo muralist who exhibited work at Miami\u2019s  Art Basel  in 2014, have become celebrities there.\nWhile collectives like Calle Cerra play a role, street art \u201cis effervescent all across the island.\u201d She doesn\u2019t see it as a shift but as a \u201cmovement within the art world that\u2019s more appealing and accessible to a diverse crowd.\u201d\nMurals pop up along freeways, on cruddy streets, on abandoned storefronts, on old and new buildings, near hotels and on billboards.\nThe reclamation of these neighborhoods is all the more surprising because Puerto Rico, like so much of the Caribbean, seeks to hide its economic woes from visitors, presenting a glossy exterior rather than street art in run-down districts\nSome credit goes to a 2012 Puerto Rican law offering tax breaks to high-income mainland citizens who buy property in the commonwealth and move there\nIt is unique to the Caribbean because of the change in land use and the size of the project.\nPaulson poured $260 million into the hotels in partnership with International Hospitality Enterprises, a major owner and operator of hotels on the island.\nRegis Bahia; the Royal Isabela luxury golf course and resort; the Four Seasons, which is set to open in 2017; and  the restored $1,799-a-night Dorado Beach Ritz-Carlton Reserve  \u2014 where I played in the water slides and the roiling surf those many Sundays of my youth \u2014 will put Puerto Rico on par with glamorous St\nA very vocal culinary vanguard  seeks to resurrect Puerto Rico\u2019s past agrarian glory and transform the islands into a farm-to-table haven\nSome of the best food in Puerto Rico can be found these days at Jos\u00e9 Enrique ,  a modest pink casita a block from the nearly century-old farmers\u2019 market Placita de Santurce, a neighborhood of produce and meat stands and down-home criollo bodegas\nThey ordered nearly half the menu and a bottle of Spanish red\nJos\u00e9 Enrique, of course, has branched out, and has a restaurant in El Blok inn in Vieques, the North Fork of Puerto Rico\nSmall planes land every day on the hour, flying in supplies, groceries and tourists from the Puerto Rican mainland seven miles away.\nMany of those are owned or rented by seasonal visitors like the New Yorkers and New Englanders who make up a sizable number of Vieques regulars.\nBut no structure was more striking than El Blok, a new inn set back on a corner lot of the malecon in Esperanza, a seafront strip of quaint restaurants and stores\nStanding in the bar-restaurant area ,  El Blok\u2019s co-owner, Simon Baeyertz, a dashing New Zealander and longtime record industry executive, explained his reasoning for opening an upscale hotel there\n\u201cI do see El Blok as part of a young, cool and creative Puerto Rico that is making the country a far more interesting destination than it has been in the past.\u201d\nThe outside of the buildings is left raw and the interior spare\nA former CBS marketing and advertising executive, he had an itch to live in the Caribbean and when the chance came, he grabbed it\nNothing like it existed in the traditional Spanish and Mediterranean architecture of my childhood, least of all on Vieques, which was a backwater none of us mainland Puerto Ricans cared to visit.\nFor me, no visit to Puerto Rico is complete without a walk up and down the steep cobblestone streets of Old San Juan, the 500-year-old Spanish colonial city that is Puerto Rico\u2019s heart\nIt was early afternoon and there was hardly a seat available in the main room\nAround the Teatro Tapia I ran into a gridlock of people, food stalls and buses, but I managed to find a taxi and escape before the fiestas reached their annual reveling chaos.\nThe upstart galleries, the murals of Santurce and the nontraditional hotels are all wonderful\nThe flowers seem eternally in bloom and I can see all the way through the glassed-in lobby to the sea beyond.\nI\u2019ve kept to my ritual, that and dipping in the sea as the waves roll in.\nLuisita Lopez Torregrosa, a former editor at The New York Times, is a writer based in New York\n1055 Ashford Avenue, Condado;
