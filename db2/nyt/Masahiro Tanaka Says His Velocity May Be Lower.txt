{"Summary": "Masahiro Tanaka Says His Velocity May Be Lower\n\nTanaka, the Yankees\u2019 best pitcher, is trying to reinvent himself in subtle ways, and on Saturday he said it was unlikely that his pitches would regain the velocity they had last season\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to establish a certain pitching style for this year,\u201d Tanaka said through an interpreter on Saturday before the Yankees\u2019 final spring training game against the Washington Nationals\nMaybe it is also not wise to change one\u2019s style of pitching after a highly successful first season in the major leagues\nTanaka said his elbow was fine, but he did not dismiss the notion that his new style was designed to protect the elbow.\n\u201cMy pitching style, as far as my mechanics, I\u2019m trying to relax a little bit more when I\u2019m throwing,\u201d he said\nTanaka also said he was concerned that his four-seam fastball, which tends to move in a straight line, was getting hit last year.\nLast year, Tanaka averaged 91.1 miles per hour on his four-seam fastball, according to Pitchf/x data\nTanaka himself cautioned not to expect a jump in speed.\nThe Yankees did not sign Tanaka to be a power pitcher\nBut now, Girardi said: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that he continues to use his four-seamer\n\u201cI\u2019m almost numb to it,\u201d he said after the Yankees beat the Washington Nationals, 4-3, at Nationals Park\nOrder Reprints |    Today's Paper | Subscribe", "Date": "Sun, 05 Apr 2015 00:20:18 GMT", "Image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/05/sports/05yankees1/05yankees1-moth.jpg", "Link": "http://rss.nytimes.com/c/34625/f/640382/s/451d5c4b/sc/16/l/0L0Snytimes0N0C20A150C0A40C0A50Csports0Cbaseball0Cmasahiro0Etanaka0Esays0Ehis0Evelocity0Emay0Ebe0Elower0Bhtml0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm", "Keywords": ["named john ryan murphy", "yankees designated austin romine", "final spring training game", "scandal involving performance", "ulnar collateral ligament", "real games start", "major league stadium"], "Title": "Masahiro Tanaka Says His Velocity May Be Lower", "Class": "Sports"}
