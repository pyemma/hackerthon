strengthens the case for their authenticity and importance.\nThe  first artifact  is an ossuary, or burial box for bones, bearing the Aramaic inscription \u201cJames son of Joseph brother of Jesus,\u201d that the Israeli collector who owns it says he bought from an East Jerusalem antiquities dealer in the 1970s\nThe second artifact is a tomb unearthed at a building site in the East Talpiot neighborhood of East Jerusalem in 1980 and thrust into the limelight by a  2007 documentary  movie, \u201cThe Lost Tomb of Jesus.\u201d The film was produced by James Cameron (\u201cTitanic\u201d) and written by Simcha Jacobovici, an Israeli-born filmmaker based in Toronto\nJacobovici and his supporters to argue that this was probably the tomb of the family of Jesus of Nazareth, a sensational claim rejected by most archaeologists and experts, who said that such names were very common at that time.\nCritics like Amos Kloner, the Jerusalem district archaeologist at the time, essentially accused Mr\nJacobovici and his supporters say that if it could be proved that the so-called James ossuary, whose provenance is unclear, originated in the Talpiot Tomb, the names on it, added to the cluster of names found in the tomb, would bolster the chances that the tomb belonged to the family of Jesus of Nazareth.\nHe is convinced he has made that connection by identifying a well-defined geochemical match between specific elements found in samples collected from the interiors of the Talpiot Tomb ossuaries and of the James ossuary.\nShimron said in an interview in the lobby of the King David Hotel here as he presented his as-yet unpublished findings to a reporter for the first time.\nNow retired as a senior researcher of the Geological Survey of  Israel , a government institute specializing in earth sciences, he has been involved in archaeological geology for the last 20 years.\nShimron based his research on the theory that an earthquake that convulsed Jerusalem in A.D\n\u201cThe composition of the tomb was simply frozen in time.\u201d\nHe has also studied samples of soil and rubble from inside the ossuaries\nJacobovici, who has been documenting the research for another movie, said \u201cthe production\u201d financed the lab work.\nJacobovici\u2019s movie but that it was \u201cnot part of the loop.\u201d\nThe findings, he says, clearly place the James ossuary in the same geochemical group as the Talpiot Tomb ossuaries.\nToday the Talpiot Tomb is sealed underground beneath a concrete slab in a courtyard between nondescript apartment buildings on East Talpiot\u2019s Dov Gruner Street, and its ossuaries are under the custodianship of the Israel Antiquities Authority\nShimron\u2019s findings seem likely to reawaken the controversies of the past.\nMoreover, speculation that one of the bone boxes found in Talpiot may have belonged to Mary Magdalene, while another bore the inscription \u201cJudah son of Jesus,\u201d has only added to the general contentiousness of the finds.\nThough archaeologists said the 10th was a plain, broken box that got thrown away, this, too, has spurred questions and conspiracy theories, including theories that the James ossuary was the 10th and was somehow spirited away.\nShimron access to his James ossuary for testing but said he was skeptical about the results.\nGolan said in a telephone interview, he bought the ossuary in 1976 at the latest, whereas the Talpiot Tomb was excavated in 1980.\nGolan purchased the ossuary after 1978, it could have been reclaimed by the state under Israel\u2019s antiquities law.)\nEven if the chemistry is correct, the James ossuary could have come from another tomb in East Talpiot, Mr\nGolan said of Dr\nHe said recently that it was clear that the underground entrance to the tomb had been open since antiquity and that the tomb had filled with soil abruptly as a result of a single quick event \u2014 possibly an earthquake.\nBut he discounted any possibility that the James ossuary had been spirited away when the tomb was uncovered.\n\u201cI myself have excavated a handful of tombs that were open and filled with soil,\u201d Dr\nGibson said, the scholarly community was eagerly awaiting the publication of Dr\nShimron, meanwhile, said he was bracing for an inevitable storm of criticism, including from people who find it anathema that a scientist, as he put it, should be \u201cplaying around with Jesus and Mary\u2019s bones.\u201d\nOrder Reprints |    Today's Paper | Subscribe", "Class": "General", "Keywords": ["government israel antiquities
