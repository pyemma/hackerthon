The latest report, released last month, showed that in six of 15 years since 2000, most actively managed mutual funds beat a broad benchmark, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 1,500-stock index, which serves as a proxy for the overall stock market in the United States\nThe actively managed funds came out on top as recently as 2013 and lost to the broad index in 2014\nPut simply, at least three-quarters of those actively managed mutual funds regularly failed to beat the broad market index over three, five and 10 years\nEven without expenses, they found, nearly all actively managed domestic stock funds trailed the benchmarks over three, five and 10 years\nFor example, the latest Spiva Scorecard examined the performance and characteristics of 2,080 actively managed mutual funds in existence 10 years ago\nIt would have been like running a horse race in which only 58 percent of those that started crossed the finish line\nIn this case, the researchers tracked the performance of all the original 2,080 funds over one, three, five and 10 years\nIn fact, only 33.7 percent of the original funds retained their style, an enormous shift that ought to concern investors, Ms\nIf they know of the shift, they can adjust their holdings, adding cost and possible tax liability\nMost of the stock funds in each category underperformed narrow benchmarks over three, five or 10 years\nKeith Loggie, the senior director of global research and design at S.&P\nBut, costs aside, it\u2019s exceedingly difficult to pick the funds that will outperform in the future\nA version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2015, on page BU3 of the  New York edition  with the headline: Measure for Measure, Index Funds Rule"}
