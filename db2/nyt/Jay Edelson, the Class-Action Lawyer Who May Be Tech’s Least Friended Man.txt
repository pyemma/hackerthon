This is the basis of a lawsuit against Spokeo, a search engine based in Pasadena, Calif.\nIf you have ever wondered how Facebook is able to automatically name your friends in pictures that you have uploaded to the social network, then you may be interested in a lawsuit Mr\nEdelson is full of self-deprecating comments about how he is \u201cnot technologically savvy at all\u201d and that his move into privacy law was \u201ca total accident.\u201d Nevertheless, his firm, which is based in Chicago, has become one of the most prolific filers of privacy class actions, a growing legal area that tech companies describe with a litany of unprintable terms\nThe building\u2019s lobby is full of people in suits, but the firm has the playful feel of a start-up\nMr\n\u201cHe wants to be perceived as running a tech firm, but since he\u2019s not a tech guy, the closest he will come is a law firm,\u201d said Scott A\nEdelson said during an interview in the lobby of the Four Seasons hotel in San Francisco, wearing a watch whose face was loaded with diamond flecks.\nToday he views these cases the same way Apple views its collection of iPhones and other iThings: as a line of products to be refined, repackaged and resold\nGiven the explosion of \u201cwearable\u201d technologies, along with voice and face recognition software, this could be a lucrative area.\nEdelson said before the meeting.\nThe Facebook case concerns a feature that analyzes users\u2019 photos and then suggests names to go with the faces in the picture from the users\u2019 lists of friends\nShe noted that the face-tagging feature could be turned off, at which point the data used to suggest tags to other people is deleted.\nThis was inspired, in part, by a call to the firm by someone who was leery of cameras and wanted to know if wearing a mask in public was legal.\nOne of the members of the investigative unit is Shawn Davis, a digital forensics expert who previously worked as a network security analyst\nLawyers in the room said they thought Facebook had done this without the consent of its users.\n\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t we want to go after a smaller company first?\u201d asked one of the lawyers at the meeting\nIf they sued a smaller company first, some other law firm would steal their idea, swoop in and sue Facebook \u2014 the big fish with the biggest potential rewards.\nThere is no good data on how many cases have been brought claiming privacy violations by tech companies, but lawyers say the practice is escalating with the growth of social media and mobile phones, which are tracking people virtually all of the time\nEdelson says the biggest lift to the kind of data privacy litigation he does came from Edward J\n\u201cBefore, we would to go court and judges would just scoff at us,\u201d he said\nMr\nDuring the fight over Mr\nMr\nIn addition to the video privacy law, Mr\nThe penalties for each instance of breaking these laws are small, usually in the hundreds or thousands of dollars\nWhat this means is that a company\u2019s defense strategy typically involves trying to persuade a judge to throw the suit out of court on a \u201cmotion to dismiss,\u201d or to try to prevent lawyers from suing on behalf of a class\n\u201cIt\u2019s legal gotcha, and he tries to convince you that because there\u2019s a legal gotcha with a big number, then you should pay him instead of litigating,\u201d said Michael Rhodes, a partner at the Cooley law firm in San Francisco, who has defended clients like Sony and Facebook against Mr\nEdelson grew up outside Boston and went to the University of Michigan Law School\nHis first run of technology suits, in the early 2000s, included a case that accused Register.com, which sells domain names, of running advertising on web pages it had sold to the customers for their use\nThe most muscular response to this corralling of data has been in Europe, where a sweeping new law nicknamed the \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d has set up a process for people to have links about them removed from search engines\nMr\nTwo years ago, in an attempt to head off a class-action lawsuit involving Gmail, the company wrote in a legal filing that people who used the service should never have expected their emails to be private, and it compared Gmail correspondence to business letters that can be viewed by assistants in an office\nEdelson and his competitors, technology companies typically argue that the named plaintiffs on privacy suits do not have \u201cstanding,\u201d which is a lawyer\u2019s way of saying that you can\u2019t sue someone for damages if you didn\u2019t lose money or get hurt\nMr\nMr\nThomas Robins, the named plaintiff in Mr\n\u201cHe is not saying that has happened to him \u2014 it\u2019s just a speculative injury that could happen,\u201d said John Nadolenco, a partner at Mayer Brown in Los Angeles, who is defending Spokeo in the case\nSpokeo has appealed that decision to the United States Supreme Court and is awaiting a response.\nThe company has a lot to lose if the case goes forward\nCompanies have filed close to a dozen legal briefs in support of Spokeo\nWhatever happens at the Supreme Court, Mr\n\u201cIf we didn\u2019t allow class actions, we would be in a much worse world,\u201d said Michael Klausner, a professor at Stanford Law School\n\u201cIt may only be a matter of time before it is impossible for employees and consumers to file class actions,\u201d Mr\nEdelson filed several dozen individual arbitrations over the course of a year\nHe says he is acting like a sort of private attorney general, forcing companies to change their worst behaviors\nMr\n\u201cThe funniest thing is you talk about it in the abstract, and people have one reaction,\u201d he said, \u201cbut then you give them specific examples, like I\u2019ll explain a case or something to them, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, yeah, that\u2019s really messed up\nOrder Reprints |    Today's
