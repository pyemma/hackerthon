{"Summary": "On Tennis: As Serena Williams Ascends, Grand Slam Buzz Grows\n\n\u2014 The women\u2019s final between  Serena Williams  and Carla Su\u00e1rez Navarro on Saturday at the Miami Open was predictably brutal and mercifully brief.\nBut perhaps it is best not to dwell too much on Saturday\u2019s foregone conclusion and on Williams\u2019s eighth singles title in Miami\nWilliams has achieved a great deal in her 33 years and has been making up for lost titles in this dominant late phase of her career\nStill, she is 18-0 so far in 2015 (with one withdrawal), and watching her fight past third-seeded Simona Halep in a classic match Thursday and overwhelm Su\u00e1rez Navarro in a dud Saturday made it clear that she has the will and the skill to run the table as she chases Margaret Court\u2019s record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles\n\u201cListen, if she wants to get to 23, 24, 25 Grand Slam singles titles, she had better not miss occasions.\u201d\nCould this be the year? Sure, it could\n\u201cObviously, anyone that wins the Australian Open wants to win a Grand Slam,\u201d Williams said Saturday without so much as an arched eyebrow\nHer single-handed backhand chip is generally crisper and more versatile, as evidenced by the lunging back-to-the-net winner she hit down the line on a crucial point against Sabine Lisicki in the quarterfinals.\nIt\u2019s great to see somebody want it that badly, to do everything they can possibly do to be the best they can be\nIt is also remarkable that Williams is not the only singles player with a reasonable chance at a Grand Slam this year\n\u201cThat would be the thing that could springboard him into pop culture, sporting lexicon and all that iconic stuff,\u201d Justin Gimelstob, John Isner\u2019s coach, said after Djokovic beat Isner in the semifinals Friday\nNadal has been too at home on it for everyone else\u2019s good, but he has won the Australian Open just once\nDjokovic has paid his dues in Paris and then some, but he seems to be gathering strength as Nadal searches for it.\nDjokovic has had some shaky moments this year, figuratively and literally (remember his trembling hands on a changeover en route to beating Federer last month in the final in Indian Wells, Calif.)\n\u201cThere are just so many things that have to go right,\u201d Navratilova said\nOrder Reprints |    Today's Paper | Subscribe", "Date": "Sun, 05 Apr 2015 00:36:15 GMT", "Image": "http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2015/04/05/sports/05clarey/05clarey-moth.jpg", "Link": "http://rss.nytimes.com/c/34625/f/640382/s/451d5db7/sc/35/l/0L0Snytimes0N0C20A150C0A40C0A50Csports0Ctennis0Cas0Eserena0Ewilliams0Eascends0Egrand0Eslam0Ebuzz0Egrows0Bhtml0Dpartner0Frss0Gemc0Frss/story01.htm", "Keywords": ["seeded su\u00e1rez navarro conceded", "carla su\u00e1rez navarro", "overwhelm su\u00e1rez navarro", "24 grand slam singles titles", "25 grand slam singles titles", "grand slam singles titles", "su\u00e1rez navarro"], "Title": "On Tennis: As Serena Williams Ascends, Grand Slam Buzz Grows", "Class": "Sports"}
