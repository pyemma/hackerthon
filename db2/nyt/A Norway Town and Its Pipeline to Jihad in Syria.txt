clapboard houses in southern Norway \u2014 had been having run-ins with the police for years but then suddenly halted their marijuana-fueled gatherings in the basement apartment of Mr\nPolice officers in this placid Norwegian town had busted their marijuana parties so regularly that \u201cwe knew them all on a first-name basis,\u201d recalled Ragnar Foss, head of a local police unit responsible for youth crime\nHammer and at least seven other young men who lived on or around just one street, Lislebyveien, made their way to  Syria  to wage jihad alongside the Islamic State and other militant groups.\nIt is also one that has flummoxed security services from Denmark to Germany to France.\nBeneath an alluring image as a personable and handsome local hero, he harbored a deep commitment to jihad and was among the first to go.\nWith its pleasant rows of wooden houses on green lawns behind neat fences and hedges, the town is orderly, clean and safe, fronted by a picturesque harbor\nPerhaps the most determining factor in their decisions to go to Syria was their influence on one another.\nChaib, \u201cwas the central figure,\u201d recalled Yousef Bartho Assidiq, a native Norwegian convert to Islam who visited Fredrikstad several times along with members of Prophet\u2019s Umma, a radical group from Oslo that openly supports the Islamic State.\n\u201cHe was the cool guy everyone wanted to be.\u201d\nMr\nChaib, who was of Algerian descent and then 23, traveled to Syria, ostensibly for humanitarian work, and was killed the following month.\nTributes flooded a memorial page on Facebook \u2014 and youths in the Fredrikstad district of Lisleby, six of whom went to Mr\nChaib\u2019s death, according to a fellow soccer player who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution from radicals, only enhanced his reputation and set an example of heroic sacrifice that others wanted to follow.\nChaib\u2019s support for jihad to the skill of a \u201cstrong soccer player who does something good on the field and makes all the other players want to do even better.\u201d\nMr\n\u201cNone of them ever even mentioned religion when we knew them,\u201d said Mr\n\u201cThe only thing they had in common is that they did not function in society,\u201d he added\n\u201cIt is ready and all you have to do is accept it,\u201d Mr\nOut of place and searching for purpose, Mr\nMr\nAlso attracted by the certainties and a sense of superiority offered by radical Islam was Samiulla Khan, who lived just down the road from Mr\nThe son of immigrants from Pakistan, Mr\nAnother schoolmate of Mr\nEdelbijev complained a lot about Russian brutality in Chechnya and Israeli treatment of  Palestinians\nWhere he went in Oslo is not known, but the city has a number of mosques and meeting places frequented by activists from Prophet\u2019s Umma and other radical groups.\nShe did not make much of this at the time but now thinks the phones were part of preparations for travel by himself and others to Syria\nIn August 2013, while his parents were on vacation in Tunisia, he sent them a text message: \u201cPlease don\u2019t try to find me\nHammer, who lived a short walk away, and his friends about their marijuana habit and their failure to observe the teachings of Islam.\nMr\nTheir sudden fervor, he said, struck him as odd but did not stir great concern\nEdelbijev, Mr\nHammer informed his mother that he was going on vacation in Greece\nThree of the others who went to Syria from Lisleby have already been reported dead\nMr\nLate last year he found himself in the thick of fighting after the Islamic State sent him to join forces besieging Kobani, a mostly Kurdish town on the border with Turkey\nHis family learned of his death from his new 18-year-old wife, a woman from the Russian region of Dagestan whom he had met in Syria\n6, she blew herself up in a suicide attack on a Turkish police post, killing a police officer and her own unborn baby.\nThe article also referred erroneously to Istanbul as the capital of Turkey\nA version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2015, on page A1 of the  New York edition  with the headline:
