town.\nHeatherwick presented an idea for a new pier that would jut into the river at West 13th Street and replace Pier 54, which was closed the year before, after it started to collapse.\nThe shuttered 875-foot pier was where survivors of the Titanic were brought in 1912\nTaylor , who is chairwoman of the Hudson River Park Trust\u2019s board of directors, referring to Mr\n\u201cIt showed the amount of work he put into it \u2014 his imagination,\u201d said  Madelyn Wils, the president of the trust , a public benefit corporation that oversees the development and operation of the park\nDiller runs with  his wife , the fashion designer  Diane von Furstenberg ,  committed at least $113 million toward the project .\n\u201cI have always liked the idea of public art and public places, and that\u2019s just been growing in me over decades,\u201d Mr\nPier 55, as the new pier-cum-culture-island is called, was showered with supportive sound bites from the governor\u2019s office and City Hall.\nThe talks surrounding the plan had been so secretive, though, that the announcement was a surprise to even the closest observers of the park\nGlick, a Democrat whose district includes part of the park, was among those who found the new plan problematic.\nShe said there was no mention then that the trust was deep in talks with Mr\n\u201cThey cast it as a redevelopment of the pier from narrow and long to short and wide,\u201d Ms\n\u201cObviously, I was concerned that we were never provided the full explanation of what they wanted,\u201d she said\nPaulson, the hedge fund manager,  pledged $100 million to Central Park  in October 2012, advocates for smaller, scruffier parks around the city cried foul, saying the gift highlighted inequities in the park system.\nRechnitz, a wealthy cycling aficionado, said he would give $40 million to build a field house and velodrome in Brooklyn Bridge Park, it was viewed as a white elephant, and he eventually  withdrew the plan .\nSimilarly, the $113 million for Pier 55, for which Hudson River Park still has only an oral pledge  from Mr\nThose same preservationists look at the money for the Pier 54 replacement with a critical eye\nDiller,\u201d said Andrew Berman, executive director of the  Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation .\n\u201cBut it does seem a little curious that there\u2019s this vast pool of largely private \u2014 but also public \u2014 money for this addition to the park,\u201d he said\nThe idea was to transform the largely derelict Hudson River waterfront from Battery Place to West 59th Street into a continuous greensward, with a bicycle path and piers for recreation\nInitially, officials said it would cost about $300 million to build the park, which was expected to be completed in 2003\nBut that park, on the East River, is about one-seventh the size of Hudson River Park\nLast year, millions of visitors went there to fish, kayak, skateboard, salsa dance and learn about the estuary\nThe 15-acre pier, where the trust has its offices, was supposed to be a revenue producer for the park \u2014 one of several to host commercial development.\nBut a number of development proposals \u2014 big-box retail, an entertainment complex, a circus \u2014 collapsed under the weight of community opposition\nIt also closed a play area in the southwest corner of the doughnut-shaped pier, where the pilings were deemed unsafe.\nThen Hurricane Sandy devastated the park, its floodwaters frying miles of electrical cable and causing $32 million in damage\nA proposal to sell those rights to the owner of the sprawling St\nBut park officials, sensitive to the pier\u2019s role as a performance site, immediately set out to find a solution.\nDiller, a San Francisco native who has long lived in New York, bicycles in the park, as do his employees\nThree separate  gifts to the High Line , totaling $35 million, put the couple in the first ranks of park philanthropists\n\u201cWe thought, \u2018Well, someone who is sort of obvious to go talk to is  Barry Diller ,\u2019\u00a0\u201d said Ms\n\u201cBarry was cool at the beginning,\u201d Ms\nBut he listened to their request \u2014 $35 million for a new pier, which would supplement the anticipated government contribution\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Look, if I\u2019m going to be interested in this, we have to do something ambitious architecturally,\u2019\u00a0\u201d Ms\nHeatherwick to a field in Islip, on Long Island, to see a mock-up of the pier, using ropes to delineate the amphitheater, a piazza and the width of paths\nDiller was hoisted up over the field in a cherry picker\nRather, the new pier would be built slightly to the north, with a different geometry, which would require 300 new concrete columns to penetrate the undisturbed riverbed in a part of the Hudson designated as an estuarine sanctuary.\nTobi Bergman, chairman of Community Board 2, which passed a resolution in January in support of Pier 55, said he was not bothered by the secrecy of the deal\nThe pier is expected to be finished in late 2018 or early 2019, and Mr\nWils called the final plan a \u201chome run.\u201d\nPiers 26 and 97 also need to be completed for public use, along with a five-acre parcel on landfill at Gansevoort Street that the Sanitation Department has been ordered to relinquish.\nWils estimates the cost of finishing the public portions of the park \u2014 beyond Pier 54 \u2014 at $175 million.\nWils said, making the case that Hudson River Park had attracted billions in real estate investment to the west side of Manhattan.\nAs to the idea that Mr\nIt was a statement that Hudson River Park deserved to be in the same league as the city\u2019s other signature, showy spaces.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to put the park on the map in ways that it has not been,\u201d said Mr\nA version of this article appears in print on April 5, 2015, on page MB1 of the
