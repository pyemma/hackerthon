Aisles", "Summary": "Private Eyes in the Grocery Aisles\n\nMansour Samadpour makes his way through the supermarket like a detective working a crime scene, slow, watchful, up one aisle and down the next\nHe buys organic raspberries that might test positive for pesticides and a fillet of wild-caught fish that might be neither wild nor the species listed on the label\nSamadpour, the chief executive of  IEH Laboratories  (short for Institute for Environmental Health), sees mystery, if not downright fraud\nWhile he\u2019s out of the office, he receives a call and dispatches a team on a more pressing expedition: They need to buy various products that contain cumin, because a client just found possible evidence of peanuts, a powerful allergen, in a cumin-based spice mix\nSamadpour\u2019s network of labs to test food for inadvertent contamination and deliberate fraud, or to verify if a product is organic or free of genetically modified organisms\nThe annual cost of food-borne illnesses in the United States is $14.1 billion to $16.3 billion, according to a 2013 analysis by the Agriculture Department\nMr\ncoli 0157 in ground beef, the detection process involves a grim recipe of ground beef and a broth infused with nutrients that E\n\u201cTen years ago, it would have taken millions of dollars to sequence a genome,\u201d Mr\nSamadpour says, because of \u201clack of accountability, lack of infrastructure, lack of a culture of food safety.\u201d He says episodes like  the 2008 discovery of the toxic chemical melamine in infant formula from China  have contributed to a gradual shift in food manufacturers\u2019 attitudes toward imports.\nOnce a fish is filleted, genetic testing is the only way to confirm its identity, making it a popular category for fraud.\nA single misstep is a far greater percentage of the whole\n\u201cWe have one ketchup, one mayonnaise, one can of olives, Kirkland Signature olive oils and a couple of others.\u201d Since 2003, the United States Department of Agriculture has required the testing of beef used for ground beef, resulting in a 40 percent reduction in cases of E\nThe company expects its suppliers to absorb testing costs and gets no resistance, given the size of the resulting orders\nHe required the suppliers to test their produce and not ship it until they had the results of the tests.\nEarthbound responded to the outbreak with a \u201cmultihurdle program that places as many barriers to food-borne illness as we can,\u201d says Gary Thomas, the company\u2019s senior vice president for integrated supply chain\nMr\nand the Office of Management and Budget now operate under a court-ordered schedule that requires regulations to be issued in late 2015 and 2016.\nPutnam wrote in an email, because contamination might show up in another part of a field, and conducting more tests would increase the costs that are passed on to the consumer.\nMr\nDNATrek, a newcomer to the field, sees opportunity in another aspect of food safety testing: the need to quickly pinpoint the source of a pathogen outbreak, to avoid delays and unnecessarily broad recalls\nZografos\u2019s partner in the company, was looking for ways to trace airborne contaminants as part of a national security project financed by the Defense Department when he realized that the work could be applied to food safety\nFood fraud, a smaller segment of the universe of problem foods, is harder to detect because it can take so many forms\nWhen asked if fake food has ever crossed the threshold at Costco, Mr\nUnless a supplier pays for testing, passes and puts a U.S.D.A.-certified sticker on the bottle, consumers have no way to know whether they got extra-virgin olive oil\nCostco now has an index of DNA information on \u201call the cultivars of Tuscan olive oil, about 16 different ones,\u201d he says\n\u201cAt the supermarket level, we found that a lot of times the oil was just old and rancid,\u201d says Selina Wang, research director at the U.C\nWang says that at the center, they \u201chave seen samples with as much as 70 percent canola oil.\u201d\nDNATrek has also developed a test for products where fraud is a temptation \u2014 \u201chigh-value stuff, truffles, saffron, premium juices, honey, seafood and olive oil,\u201d Mr\nMr\nDavid Gombas, senior vice president for food safety and technology at the 111-year-old United Fresh Produce Association, echoes the position of the Food and Drug Administration: Testing is not a sufficient answer for his members, who include anyone engaged in the fresh produce industry, \u201cfrom guys who come up with seeds to growers, shippers, fresh-cut processors, restaurants and grocery stores, everyone from beginning to end,\u201d from small organic farms to Monsanto.\n\u201cThey can find one dead salmonella cell on a watermelon, but what does that tell you about the rest of the watermelon in the field? Nothing.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m a fan of testing,\u201d he says, \u201cif something funny\u2019s going on.\u201d Otherwise, he has taken on the role of contrarian\nMr\nIEH tested the contents of Mr\nSamadpour assumed that was the result of an errant breeze from a nearby nonorganic field.\nThe beef and pork were cross-contaminated \u2014 each had amounts of the other \u2014 a common occurrence, he says, when markets grind first one batch of meat and then the other\nAs for the cumin and the peanuts, the F.D.A\nPeople who are highly allergic or sensitive to peanuts may be at risk of a serious or life-threatening allergic reaction.\u201d\n\u201cOther than the label somebody\u2019s written,\u201d Mr\nMr\nOrder Reprints |    Today's Paper | Subscribe"}
