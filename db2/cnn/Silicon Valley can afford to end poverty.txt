{"Summary": "Silicon Valley can afford to end poverty\n\nEmail him at  ctl@cnn.com\n\"A lot of people just walked by and didn't even look at us in the eyes\nAnother participant in the march, Raj Jayadev, told me it felt \"like a parable.\" I have to agree\nIt's high time for Apple, Google, Facebook and other Silicon Valley companies to acknowledge their role in creating a valley that not only is an economic powerhouse but also is crippled by inequality and poverty\nThey aren't helping enough\nIn November, after readers of this website voted for me to cover this topic as part of the  Change the List series ,  I visited Silicon Valley to document child poverty for CNN\nThe Samaritan House  helped her out of homelessness and into that garage\nA family of four would need an often-unattainable $60,000 to $100,000 a year just to get by, according to the  Insight Center for Community Economic Development .\nThe company is valued at more than  $730 billion , which is  more than the GDP of Switzerland .\nSan Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo told me these inequities are the \"moral shame\" of Silicon Valley\nThe Chronicle of Philanthropy, for example, lists  three Silicon Valley tech billionaires among its top 10 American donors of 2014\nThe  Silicon Valley Community Foundation , which holds $6.5 billion in assets and is the main target of the valley's big donors, gave less than 46% of its 2014 grants to organizations in the greater San Francisco Bay Area, which includes Silicon Valley as well as seven additional counties\nIt is, but it's also clearly not enough\nWhile there are countless worthy causes around the world, I find it hugely upsetting that poverty and homelessness are allowed to persist in Silicon Valley amid such jaw-dropping wealth\nThe donor gets a tax break immediately -- and can decide later how and where to spend the money, as long as it goes to a nonprofit.\n\"(Facebook CEO Mark)  Zuckerberg gave a billion to the community foundation , and it's sitting there,\" said Peter Hero, founder and principal of the Hero Group and former CEO of the community foundation's predecessor organization\n\"Being a good neighbor is extremely important to Facebook,\" the company said in an e-mailed statement\nIn addition to funding solutions, however, the area's most influential people -- the billionaires who design our smartphones and shape the digital world -- also could throw some more hip behind smart policies that would help people survive\nLocated south of San Francisco, the valley is hemmed by mountains and ocean on the west and mountains on the east\nThat's offensive and impossible for two reasons: There's no place to go but the Central Valley of California, which is largely agricultural and would result in an expensive, two-hour commute; and because Silicon Valley needs low-wage workers, both to function economically and to be a diverse, inclusive society\nIn one particularly shocking example, which the San Jose Mercury News detailed in 2013, voters in Palo Alto rejected a 60-unit apartment complex for low-income seniors\nEach seems to be hoping that  someone else  will allow denser, taller housing developments\n\"It's a death (by) a thousand cuts,\" he said\n\"Just as we would expect any other piece of our community to respond when something is not working for the vast majority, I think there is a responsibility for these tech companies to engage in conversation and to be part of the solution -- and to really be a part of this community\nMany of the valley's engineers ride company-owned buses to a company-owned \"campus,\" where they get a free company-funded lunch at a company-owned cafeteria\nIt's as if the tech giants have manufactured a way to keep employees from caring about the people and places around them\n\"It's becoming a region of rich people and its servants, and it shouldn't be that way\n\"We need people to participate -- to serve on the board of the food bank, to serve on the board of the preschool association\nBill Somerville, founder of the  Philanthropic Ventures Foundation , and another major player in Silicon Valley philanthropy, agrees\n\"The big question is, 'What is Silicon Valley doing with regards to poverty in its midst?' \" he said\nIn an e-mailed statement, Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet said the company donated $50 million to Standord's hospitals; supports technology in schools; and matches employee donations to charitable organizations, including making donations when employees volunteer\nSince 2010 we've given more than $100 million to local nonprofits and employees have volunteered thousands of hours in the community; we're excited to be expanding that work in 2015.\"\nEmployees, for example, donated $1.3 million to the  Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Clara and San Mateo Counties  last holiday season.\nTami Cardenas, vice president of development and marketing for the food bank, told me many of the valley's tech executives and employees are \"incredibly generous,\" and that companies, many in tech, provided 18% of the organization's $32.5 million in revenue for the fiscal year ending in June 2014\nAnd it remains true that \"there are a lot of hungry kids, and there are a lot of hungry people in these counties,\" Cardenas said.\nThere are reasons for hope, however\nOne is Fernandez and the  Silicon Valley Rising movement\nAnd  contract bus drivers for Facebook , meanwhile, voted to unionize\nWe're going to have to demand it, and we're going to have to work for it.\"\nThe mall splits the line between the communities of San Jose and Santa Clara, according to the report, and each of those municipalities paid a different minimum wage.\nAnother bright spot is  Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce , based in San Francisco\n\"As practiced today,  capitalism too often becomes a race to the bottom ,\" he wrote in a Huffington Post op-ed\nMore progress than we're currently making, certainly\nNot all of the companies are located in Silicon Valley, but Apple ($69.7 billion offshore in total) and Google ($47.4 billion offshore) are listed as among the biggest offenders\n\"The difference with Silicon Valley is we're the one region in the country that could actually eliminate child poverty -- because of the amount of accumulated wealth,\" said Raj Jayadev, from the group  Silicon Valley De-Bug , which raises awareness about poverty and other social justice issues in the valley\nThe point seems to be for a few people to get wildly rich\nAnd, consequently, to drive low- and middle-income people away\nIt doesn't have to be like that", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Wed, 25 Mar 2015 13:03:56 EDT", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150225170938-change-the-list-poverty-jungle-image-2-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "Silicon Valley can afford to end poverty", "Keywords": ["san jose mayor sam liccardo told", "san jose mercury news detailed", "san jose homeless shelter operated", "foundation spokeswoman sue mcallister told", "group called  family supportive housing", "greater san francisco bay area", "avoid higher tax rates"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/RKOEG5jTa0c/index.html"}
