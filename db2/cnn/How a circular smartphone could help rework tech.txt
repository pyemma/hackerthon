{"Summary": "How a circular smartphone could help rework tech\n\n(WIRED) Screens are rectangles\nFor the last year, the three-person team has been working a circular, palm-sized device dubbed Runcible\nThey cheekily refer to it as the \"anti-smartphone,\" a description that goes for both its form factor and its value system\nIt's a challenge to the rectangular status quo and everything it represents\nAnd then of course there are windows\u2014in some ways the original glass rectangles\nIn each case, the rectangle's prominence can be attributed in large part to practicality\nAs frames for shaping the world, however, different types of rectangles can produce vastly different effects\nIn her book The Virtual Window, which traces the rectangular frame from Renaissance painting up through Microsoft Windows, media theorist Anne Friedberg offers an example from the history of architecture, centering on a public feud between French builder August Perret and the preeminent modernist architect Le Corbusier\nThe simple act of turning a rectangle on its side gave us entirely new ways to think about space.\n(In 1930, Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein lamented how the cinema's \"passive horizontalism.\" He wanted the screen to be square.)\nPaired with the never-ending vertical feeds that fill apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, they've become an irresistible, inexhaustible diversion.\nThey shape the type of stuff that's made for them\n\"It's time now to use technology to get a little quieter.\"\nAnd the shape of the device is central to that thinking\nSo what is it good for? That's the question\nThe three-person team, which has been working with the San Francisco design studio Box Clever on the concept for nearly a year, has some prototype hardware and a crude sketch of an operating system, but they've still got a long way to go\nOne is a sort of dashboard that gives you an overview of activity on your social media accounts\nSmartphones are distracting, sure, but they're also incredibly useful and immensely entertaining and maybe a little distraction is a fair price to pay for all the good stuff.\nStill, even as a hint of a possible device, Runcible is compelling\nIf today's interactive rectangles and infinite feeds signal that there's always more stuff just outside the frame, circles could offer something more self-contained, more complete\nA circular device would sever the link to the printed page, the TV and the computer, and invite developers to look elsewhere for metaphor and inspiration\nIf nothing else, the concept could be valuable simply for helping us identify some of the assumptions and habits that underlie our existing devices\nRuncible is just one scrappy, literal attempt to abandon the rectangle\nAlso note the recent rise of circular avatars over the traditional square ones in apps and interfaces of all kinds).\nAnd then of course there are technologies like augmented reality and virtual reality, where your nose is effectively pressed so close to the glass that the frame disappears entirely\nHere, the screen is less of a window, more of a lens\nJust recently, in fact, we saw an instance of a tech industry giant leaving the glass rectangle behind in a very big way\nThey're nothing but windows, or maybe they're so radical that the concept of \"window\" doesn't even really apply", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Thu, 02 Apr 2015 08:40:35 EDT", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150312095933-runcible-anti-smartphone-heirloom-electronic-monohm-01-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "How a circular smartphone could help rework tech", "Keywords": ["san francisco design studio box clever", "russian filmmaker sergei eisenstein lamented", "media theorist anne friedberg offers", "preeminent modernist architect le corbusier", "tech industry giant leaving", "french builder august perret", "monohm ceo aubrey anderson"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/4F7B5Jui9W4/index.html"}
