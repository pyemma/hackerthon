{"Summary": "NASA's Mars rover celebrates milestone\n\n(CNN) It certainly won't be troubling any earth-based runners' personal bests, but NASA's long-serving Mars rover Opportunity set a significant benchmark Tuesday as it clocked in 26.219 miles (42 kilometers) -- the first-ever Martian marathon\n\"This is the first time any human enterprise has exceeded the distance of a marathon on the surface of another world,\" said John Callas, Opportunity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California\nIt beat out previous record-holder, the Soviet-era Lunokhod 2 moon rover in the distance stakes\n\"This mission isn't about setting distance records, of course,\" said Cornell University's Steve Squyres, the Opportunity mission's principal investigator\nWithin months of beginning its Martian mission, Opportunity had discovered evidence of both running and groundwater on the mostly barren planet\nOpportunity is currently on the rim of the huge Endeavor crater, which it has spent the last four years traversing\nAlong with its sister rover Curiosity and three Mars orbiters, it will seek to understand more about our nearest planetary neighbor, including \"its present and past environment, climate cycles, geology and biological potential,\" NASA said in a statement\nNASA's previous Martian resident, the Spirit rover, ceased communication with ground control in 2010", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Mon, 30 Mar 2015 08:58:09 EDT", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150325122427-mars-opportunity-spirit-rover-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "NASA's Mars rover celebrates milestone", "Keywords": ["serving mars rover opportunity set", "mars feels pretty cool", "develop human spaceflight capabilities", "era lunokhod 2 moon rover", "length relay run", "huge endeavor crater", "jet propulsion laboratory"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/82lx7qIMOV8/index.html"}
