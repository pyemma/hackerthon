{"Summary": "The fastest plane in the world\n\nIn 1976 they smashed the world aviation speed record by blasting across the Western United States in  America's super spy plane, the Lockheed SR-71\nOfficial speed: 2,193 mph\n\"It wasn't supposed to be that big of a deal,\" Joersz said on the phone from his home in Temple, Texas\nBut it's still kind of a big deal\nmilitary demonstration for the  World Air Sports Federation , the international group that oversees aviation records.\nMorgan, who spoke with CNN by phone from his home in Hoodsport, Washington, said they were lucky to get the assignment\nMoving at 2,193 mph may be hard to wrap your head around\nAirmen Al Joersz, left, and George Morgan hold a bicentennial American flag after breaking the world aviation speed record in 1976\nIn fact, the SR-71 proved itself from the 1960s through the 1990s as an important intelligence tool that helped ease rising U.S.-Soviet tensions during the Cold War.\nJoersz recalls that the tanks were almost full \u2014 filled with a unique fuel developed especially for the plane's two huge, powerful engines.\nThen Joersz put his left hand on the throttle, pushed it forward and aircraft Number 17958 took off.\nSoon they were soaring at 80,600 feet \u2014 more than twice the altitude of passenger jets \u2014 so high that Joersz remembers seeing the curvature of the Earth.\n\"I was watching very closely to make sure we were right on the money,\" Morgan said\nTo break the record, the rules called for Joersz to turn the plane around and repeat the same path at virtually the same altitude\nand began the turn \u2014 90 degrees to the left, then a 270-degree turn to the right,\" Joersz said\nThe celebration included generals, Lockheed executives and a congratulatory phone call with the commander in chief of the Air Force Strategic Air Command.\nFinal calculations showed that Joersz and Morgan had broken the previous record by 123 mph -- set by a similar Air Force spy plane, the YF-12A, in the '60s.\nThey actually thought they could do better, hoping for 2,200 mph, said Joersz\nIt's easy to imagine it streaking across the sky that day in 1976\n\u2022  Tires that were infused with aluminum powder to ward off temperatures upward of 600 degrees Fahrenheit\n\u2022  Quartz-covered cockpit windows, which got so hot from high-speed friction that pilots warmed their in-flight meals by holding their food up to the glass\nThe pressurized flight suits added to \"the mystique, the magic, the drama of this airplane,\" Joersz said\nYou had to pay a lot of attention and be prepared to handle little things it would throw at you once in a while.\"\nIf your helmet hit the left cockpit window \u2014 bam! \u2014 that meant it was the right engine\nReconnaissance Systems Officer George Morgan stands in front of a Cold War-era U.S\nIf the pilot failed to control the unstart, \"The nose would pitch up,\" said Joersz\n\"After a while you kind of got used to them.\" Eventually the planes were outfitted with an automatic system that helped pilots manage unstarts\n\"Lockheed changed the sealant composition many times through the years trying to get one that would work better than the last one \u2014 trying to solve the issue of the leaks,\" Joersz said\n\"It didn't pour out, but it was leaking \u2014 yeah \u2014  drip, drip drip,\" said Morgan\nThe plane wasn't just fast\nJoersz and Morgan flew missions in separate planes over the region.\n\"Making a turn, we took a picture of a soccer game which was off to the side about 12-15 miles away and we could see the soccer ball coming off a guy's foot,\" Morgan said\nThe spy planes returned with \"photographic information that allowed us to provide a clear picture of how the war was progressing,\" Joersz said\nNonetheless, the aircraft was such a valuable spy tool that Washington had a hard time breaking up with it\nThey just go hide 'til the satellite goes away,\" Morgan said\nBut the Pentagon missed it so much, the plane briefly returned to duty in the '90s\nIt sits next to other military surveillance icons, the Global Hawk and the U2.\nNow age 71 and retired, Joersz is confident a new aircraft will someday break the record, perhaps reaching five or even six times the speed of sound\nLockheed Martin says it's developing a successor to the legendary supersonic SR-71 spy jet\nAs the 40th anniversary of their famous flight draws near, Joersz is considering a trip to Georgia to reconnect with the plane that put him in the record books\nMorgan, now 74, also would love to reunite with the fastest plane in the world\n\"That's my baby,\" Morgan said", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Thu, 02 Apr 2015 08:20:29 EDT", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150224111058-sr71-blackbird-pilots-morgan-joersz-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "The fastest plane in the world", "Keywords": ["national decision makers make wise decisions", "morgan fed joersz audio cues alerting", "reconnaissance systems officer george morgan stands", "air force strategic air command", "warner robins air force base", "similar air force spy plane", "president richard nixon moved"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/jswpoTnXUsk/index.html"}
