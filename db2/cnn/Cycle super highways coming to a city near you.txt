{"Summary": "Cycle super highways coming to a city near you\n\nAt one stage, it was even thought to be the transport of the future\nBy 1900, even its chief investor had lost faith in its future\n\"I have concluded that we are a little ahead of time on this cycleway\nAnd some of the solutions -- in terms of infrastructure and bicycle technology -- are as surprising as they are innovative.\nDensely populated and with a streetscape that owes more to its medieval layout than to the grid patterns of major U.S\nCalled the East-West Cycle Superhighway, the separated bicycle path would connect Acton in West London with Barking in the east -- a journey of more than 18 miles.\nGetting more people on to their bikes will reduce pressure on the road, bus and rail networks, cut pollution, and improve life for everyone, whether or not they cycle themselves.\"\n\"Our concept proposes repurposing underutilized infrastructure to provide quick links between existing tube stations and key London landmarks and destinations,\" said Ian Mulcahey, managing director of Gensler London, the architecture and design firm behind the idea.\n\"Ideas to put cycles in the sky, or underground, are completely counter to the principle that cycling should be made an attractive and convenient option, and perpetuate the incorrect notion that there isn't enough space above ground to provide Dutch-style solutions", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Wed, 04 Mar 2015 12:01:02 EST", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150217112123-skycycle-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "Cycle super highways coming to a city near you", "Keywords": ["campaign manager rosie downes told cnn", "tomorrow transformed  explores innovative approaches", "concept proposes repurposing underutilized infrastructure", "famous architecture firm norman foster", "elevated cycleway connecting los angeles", "ambitious bicycle path infrastructure projects", "licensed taxi drivers association"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/52E_SWBP-cQ/index.html"}
