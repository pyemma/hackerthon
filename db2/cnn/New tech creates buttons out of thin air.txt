{"Summary": "New tech creates buttons out of thin air\n\nThe company's tagline says it all: \"Feeling without touching.\"\nThrough an emission of sound waves, sensations are projected through the air and to the user\nBut even though it is  incredibly convincing , virtual reality completely bypasses the sense of touch: applying UltraHaptics' technology to it would allow users to not just see the virtual world projected in front of their eyes, but to touch it as well\nSmartphones and other popular devices could also see benefits: controlling appliances in the kitchen, using TVs and computers in a style reminiscent of the movie \"Minority report\", or even snoozing the alarm in the morning would all become just a matter of waving your hands\nSeveral devices  can already be controlled with gestures, but UltraHaptics add an extra layer of feedback, by generating the sensation of a force field: \"Haptics is more than just the sense of touch\n\"If you put your hand in the way, it actually emits enough of a force on your hand to slightly displace your skin\nWhat you eventually get is a sensation of vibration on your hands,\" Carter explained.\nAnd we were very surprised at how keen the automotive industry is to work with us,\" Carter said.", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Wed, 01 Apr 2015 08:26:21 EDT", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150325144912-3d-shapes-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "New tech creates buttons out of thin air", "Keywords": ["home appliance companies making cooker hoods", "consumer electronics companies making things", "virtual reality completely bypasses", "enhancing virtual reality", "virtual reality headsets", "virtual reality goggles", "suspended tactile surfaces"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/2V764avUJ38/index.html"}
