{"Summary": "'Bloons' may let tourists experience near space\n\nBallooning is already tried and tested technology -- \"It's the origin of space travel,\" explains Annelie Schoenmaker, external relations and legal officer for  Zero2infinity , a Spanish company that plans to launch passengers to near space using balloons known as \"Bloons\" for \u20ac110,000 ($124,000) a time\n\"For me this time was what I call the first space race, as it was the first time we went into the stratosphere,\" explains Dr Jonathan Clark, an associate professor in neurology and space medicine, who has advised on both Red Bull Stratos and StratEx -- the project that saw Google executive Alan Eustace make a  record-breaking space dive , assisted by ballooning company  World View Enterprises\nTo this day ballooning is hugely important for space science; NASA and other commercial companies use balloons as an inexpensive means to test payloads in near-space environments\nBecause balloons can spend a relatively large amount of time in the stratosphere, this \"gives increased observation and experiment runs,\" explains Jane Poynter, CEO of World View, which will offer near-space ballooning trips for $75,000\n\"But it is pretty close and it gives you a totally different experience,\" says Michael Lopez-Alegria, former NASA astronaut and president of the  Commercial Spaceflight Federation\nPassengers would also be able to see the Earth in the blackness of space, as well as the sun rise over the curvature of the planet\n\"It's very easy,\" says Schoenmaker, \"put in helium, release the balloon and up it goes, very slowly.\"\n\"Our capsule is fitted with state-of-the-art space-rated life support systems, designed and manufactured by Paragon Space Development Corporation, who are global leaders in life support technology,\" says Poynter, of the World View system.\nOnce there, inside a capsule attached to the balloon, crew and passengers can bob along on the edge of our atmosphere for up to two hours\nSchoenmaker explains: \"For safety, we also have a further two back-up chutes.\" The descent back to Earth takes around an hour, meaning there is no big acceleration, with the capsule landing in a predetermined location, guided back to Earth by a pilot and the support of mission control\nThe ultimate aim for near-space ballooning is that the experience will be comparable to getting on a commercial airliner\nWith extensive unmanned testing already underway, the hope for World View is that it could launch as soon as the end of 2016, with Bloon expecting to begin flights in the next few years\nBut because the balloons don't go to space, is there actually interest for this type of experience? \"Space ballooning certainly has its market,\" believes Brad Inggs, CEO of  Orbital Horizon , a space support and intelligence solution agency, based in South Africa\nAnd balloons could also be used to launch nanosatellites from high altitude, reducing the cost of launch", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Thu, 02 Apr 2015 09:24:45 EDT", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150226132157-space-ballon-6-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "'Bloons' may let tourists experience near space", "Keywords": ["tomorrow transformed  explores innovative approaches", "google executive alan eustace make", "pressurized capsules suspended beneath helium balloons", "ballooning company  world view enterprises", "letting paying tourists experience space", "explains dr jonathan clark", "paragon space development corporation"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/k_WWOQ5KBYc/index.html"}
