{"Summary": "Yang: Internet of Things, or IdioT?\n\nAnd now that our devices are becoming interlinked as a vast always-on network, they don't even need to be supervised anymore -- our stuff can handle all of these irritating tasks just by talking with each another\nMeanwhile, your LG coffeemaker is grinding some fresh beans for next morning's automatically brewed cup of joe, and your LG smartphone is transmitting your daily schedule to your LG-enabled car system, so you can be guided directly to your first appointment when you wake up in the morning\nBut as you can tell, the problem with Internet of Things is that it depends on your having the right things -- \"smart,\" \"connected\" things\nAnd that's not even including the cost of a Hue Bridge ($200), which allows you to manage up to 50 Hue bulbs, or Hue Remote Switches ($60), which let you control your lights if your smartphone isn't handy\nAnd if an intruder tries to come through a window, your smart Canary camera system can sound the alarm and send you a picture of the trespasser, at a price tag of $200 for every opening you want protected\nThe list of smart, connected things that manufacturers want you to add to your smart, connected life gets even more elaborate from there\nIf you're constantly worrying about whether you have enough fuel to fire up the family gathering you've been planning (and who doesn't?), Quirky will sell you a wi-fi enabled Refuel Smart Propane Tank gauge for just $50\nAfter you eat, you can play in your pool (with your comfort managed by Vigilant's LilyPad floating wi-fi enabled thermometer and UV sensor, $100) or take a nap on your $4999 self-adjusting, digitally enabled ReST Bed from Boditrack\nOf course, you won't want to hit the hay without brushing your teeth first \u2014 and your Kolibree smart toothbrush will let you automatically track and share how well you polish your molars for just $99 to $200.\nWe haven't even mentioned CES's burgeoning array of products for the Internet of Pets \u2014 from the Voyce wearable fitness tracker for dogs to the PetNet smart connected feeder \u2014 or the Edyn Garden Sensor and the Parrot intelligent plant pot\nAnd the smarter and more connected your devices are...the thinner that wallet is going to be", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 09:00:11 EST", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150109111658-versaball-ces-2015-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "Yang: Internet of Things, or IdioT?", "Keywords": ["fi enabled refuel smart propane tank gauge", "lg widescreen oled ultra hd television", "wall street journal online", "essentially outsource huge aspects", "parrot intelligent plant pot", "digitally enabled rest bed", "annual gargantuan gadget gathering"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/QcnwAG7QJNM/index.html"}
