{"Summary": "NASA designs 'ape' robot for disasters\n\nNASA's  Jet Propulsion Laboratory  is working on a different kind of robot for disaster response that's designed to move like an ape\nIt has wheels it can coast on if the surface is smooth enough.\nThe RoboSimian is JPL's final entry into the  DARPA Robotics Challenge , a 27-month-long competition among some of the world's top robotic talent to create an emergency response robot\nEach robot will attempt to drive a car, move across rubble, use a tool and climb stairs, all without a human controlling it\nWhile better at manipulating objects, Surrogate ran on tracks and wasn't as adept at traversing the complicated terrain that is common in a disaster\nJPL's team is working with the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Caltech to increase the robot's walking speed\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory is most known for designing robotics for space exploration, such as the Mars rovers\nNASA also has a long history of taking technology developed for space exploration and using it here on Earth\nIn both cases, the system is designed to let the robots work as autonomously as possible when communication with a human operator is dropped\nThe team has thought hard about all aspects of RoboSimian's design, even making sure it has the right look\nBernard.\"\nWhile JPL is focused on perfecting the ape-like design for Earth-bound applications for now, this is just one stop in the circular life of NASA technology", "Class": "Technology", "Data": "Sat, 17 Jan 2015 12:02:41 EST", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/141229190309-nasa-jpl-robosimian-top-tease.jpg", "Title": "NASA designs 'ape' robot for disasters", "Keywords": ["darpa robotics challenge finals\n\nrobosimian", "darpa robotics challenge", "existing robotics research", "jet propulsion laboratory", "tasks include assembly", "execute simple tasks", "included industrial designers"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/MPMq85su2mQ/index.html"}
