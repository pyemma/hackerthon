Each is home to an innovative games studio whose success tells the story of a British industry confident that it can beat the world\nGenteel Leamington Spa seems an unlikely place to find pirates plotting to seize plunder, but this is where the Midoki company has created its hit game for the  iPad and iPhone, Plunder Pirates\nHe came from a local firm and so have most of the dozen employees.\nThat turns out to be a pretty small proportion, but among them are obsessives who spend a lot of money to try to become top pirates\nJon Webb is cagey about exact numbers of downloads and revenue - not so the company's investor and chairman, games industry veteran Ian Livingstone: \"There were two million downloads in the first three days, half of them in China,\" he tells me\nThis kind of independent business was made possible by the arrival of mobile games, where you don't need to have a publisher or be part of a giant company to get your game in front of an audience\nEven now, Midoki has to keep refreshing the game on a daily basis, keeping its community of players interested and involved\nLike many of the UK's games firms, it  threw its lot in long ago with an overseas owner, Japan's Sega, which gives its managers the financial security to think long term.\nMiles Jacobson, the director of the game, tells me that most players are football fans first rather than hardcore gamers - the aim is to see \"whether the person in the pub after the game who tells you he could have done better, really knows it all.\"\nBut what makes this game stand out is the science behind it\nSuch is the wealth of the data accumulated by Football Manager that it has done a deal to license it back to the football industry software business ProZone\nArtificial intelligence is also being employed to chew through that data as players manage their teams across the season\nThat was not the case a few years back when many games firms and developers were heading for Canada to take advantage of tax breaks\nBut Jacobson tells me the other factor is that the view of the industry, in both the City and the media, has been transformed: \"Five years ago the idea that Radio 4 would have done a piece on video games would have seemed absurd\nBut it may be the games business, where the arts and sciences come together, which offers the best hope for jobs and exports in the coming years.", "Keywords": ["games industry veteran ian livingstone", "football industry software business prozone", "virtual games inside football manager", "ugly 1970s office block", "provide similar tax treatment", "make things happen faster", "great british success stories"], "Link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32145285#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa", "Title": "British tech at the top of its game"}
