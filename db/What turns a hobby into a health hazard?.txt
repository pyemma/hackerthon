At the simplest level, healthy enthusiasms add to life and addictions take away from it\nIf any gamer endorses five or more of the following criteria they would likely be diagnosed as having IGD: (1) preoccupation with internet games; (2) withdrawal symptoms when internet gaming is taken away; (3) the need to spend increasing amounts of time engaged in internet gaming, (4) unsuccessful attempts to control participation in internet gaming; (5) loss of interest in hobbies and entertainment as a result of, and with the exception of, internet gaming; (6) continued excessive use of internet games despite knowledge of psychosocial problems; (7) deception of family members, therapists, or others regarding the amount of internet gaming; (8) use of the internet gaming to escape or relieve a negative mood;  and (9) loss of a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of participation in internet games.\nBut like any activity that is taken to excess, in a minority of cases the activity can become addictive.\nInstead of demonizing games, we need to educate gamers about the potential dangers of very excessive use.", "Keywords": ["american psychiatric association published", "decades studying videogame addiction", "international gaming research unit", "massively multiplayer online games", "gamers suffer form igd", "warrants future research", "healthy enthusiasms add"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/5JmiM5DT2lo/index.html", "Data": "Thu, 05 Feb 2015 08:06:40 EST", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150121110809-video-game-fan-top-tease.jpg"}
