{"Class": "Technology", "Title": "Why quantum dots are taking over your TV", "Summary": "Why quantum dots are taking over your TV\n\nThese electronic crystals are so tiny that 10,000 of them span just the width of a human hair\nThe color can be finely tuned and is determined by their size\nThe bigger ones -- about 50 atoms thick -- glow red, while the smallest -- 30 atoms or so -- glow green\nOn top of that, they are more energy efficient: \"Quantum dots require a tiny amount of energy to operate,\" Edelman told CNN\n\"Any new material that comes out will have this problem,\" he explained\nBut you have to make enough of this stuff that companies like Samsung can get it in the quantities they need.\nExtracting cadmium from the process, however, has changed the playing field\nNow that it can be mass-produced without heavy metals, the material is safe for medical diagnostics as well\n\"It's very rare that you see a material that is a true platform technology, meaning the same material can be used in cancer imaging, to make TVs, in security inks and in solar cells\nOne of the greatest advantages to any industry from quantum dots is that they take 30% less energy to produce the same amount of light", "Keywords": ["human hair \n\napplications include displays", "hungry edison incandescent light bulb", "possess unique optical qualities", "tiny crystals called quantum dots", "vastly improve battery life", "physics called quantum mechanics", "15 years developing quantum dots"], "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/YiM0zRKzX9o/index.html", "Data": "Thu, 02 Apr 2015 09:25:22 EDT", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150401151228-quantum-6-top-tease.jpg"}
