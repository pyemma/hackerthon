Scientists are developing smart contact lenses embedded with miniscule mirrors that can magnify your vision by almost three times\nThe 1.55mm-thick lenses incorporate a thin reflective telescope made of mirrors and filters; when light enters the eye it bounces off the series of mirrors and increases the perceived view of an object or person\n\"AMD is the biggest problem where magnification is a proven visual aid,\" says Eric Tremblay, research scientist at  EPFL  in Switzerland\nTremblay led the optical design of the lens, which is based on a surgically  implantable telescope  currently used by some patients with AMD, but which is more invasive than a lens\nA key innovation with the lenses is the added ability to switch between magnified and regular vision through a complementary pair of glasses\nA strategic wink will enable users to keep an eye on their periphery, such as cars approaching them as they cross a street, whilst also being able to zoom in and recognize the faces of those around them.\nThe challenge these lenses bring with them, however, is comfort, as they impede the amount of oxygen reaching the eye.\nBut the team hopes to improve this further still by instead developing a contact lens solution saturated with oxygen which can be stored and slowly released into the eye\nThe lenses have only been trialled on a handful of humans to test for comfort, with the majority of research to date performed in the lab using a model chemical eye\nOther prototypes have been developed to monitor, as well as improve, health in both the eye and across the body\nOne of the first examples of using lenses in this form was  Sensimed , a spin-off also emerging from EPFL\nThe traditional test used by optometrists to monitor patients uses puffs of air to measure pressure in the eye but such measurements are not ideal\nIts smart lens uses strain gauges and sensors embedded inside a chip located in the lens to measure changes in the volume of liquid in the eye as a surrogate measurement of pressure\nOptometrist James Wolffsohn, spokesperson for the  British Contact Lens Association , looks forward to one day using technologies like the telescopic lens in clinical practice\n\"The eye is the window to many disease states,\" says Bailey, who believes contact lenses are the future for eye care, both in terms of clinical use and lifestyle management\n\"Eye-sensing on contact lenses is here to stay ..", "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/n5DXQHDKcLc/index.html", "Title": "Contact lens with built-in telescope", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150304164308-smart-contact-lens---sensimed-top-tease.jpg", "Data": "Wed, 01 Apr 2015 11:26:09 EDT"}
