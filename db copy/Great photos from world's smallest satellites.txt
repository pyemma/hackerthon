And it was just a joke, but what that means, how that speaks to our missions is profound, so instead of launching a constellation of satellites, we're launching a flock of doves.\"\nOn October 28th, 2014, an Antares rocket carrying 26 Doves destined for orbit exploded fourteen seconds after launch", "Link": "http://rss.cnn.com/~r/rss/edition_technology/~3/zjc1BTYmWmk/index.html", "Title": "Great photos from world's smallest satellites", "Image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/dam/assets/150311164705-planetlabs-sf-top-tease.jpg", "Data": "Wed, 01 Apr 2015 11:21:03 EDT"}
